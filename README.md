This repository contains an iOS SwiftUI application located in `AssistantApp/`.
The app lets you talk to an animated persona powered by OpenAI's API using
speech recognition and text-to-speech.

## Building

1. Open `AssistantApp/` in Xcode.
2. Add a Lottie animation asset named `assistantAnimation` to the project.
3. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key.
4. Run the app on an iOS simulator or device.

The project uses SwiftUI, Apple's Speech framework, AVFoundation, and Lottie for animation.
